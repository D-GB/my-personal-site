      <img class="hostel1" src="index.jpeg">
      <p><strong>एक ऐसी जगह जहां आपको अपनी उम्र के लोगों के साथ रहना होगा।
एक ऐसी जगह जहां आप शुरुआत में सबसे मुश्किल दिन होते हैं लेकिन बाद में सबसे सुखद दिन होते हैं।
एक ऐसी जगह जहाँ आपको ज्यादातर काम नहीं करने होते हैं।
एक ऐसी जगह जिसमें हजार यादें होती हैं।
एक ऐसी जगह जिसे आप छोड़ते समय याद करते हैं।
एक ऐसी जगह जो आपको बहुत सी चीजें सिखाती है।</strong></p>

      <h3>About my blog.</h3>
      <p><strong>Taking the advantage of silence mostly at the end of day, I tend to ruminate on the day spent experiencing both the blissful and the apologetic moments. The thoughtful exercise often ensue with some creations both poetic and prose. Those creations with the play of words cannot exactly be termed as centring me solely but they also form a spectacle of humanity in large.

      It is the nature of my creations that sprouted the thought in me to own a blog. I considered, as the creations celebrate humanity, I have no right to keep them locked with me. I should leave them open to humanity for their enjoyment. This viewpoint made me deem the blog as the appropriate medium through which the creations can reach people.

   The blog aims to capture the panorama of humanity. Its creations will focus on different shades of moods, feelings and sentiments that colour the human mind. It, in short, will project both the grim and vivid aspects of human lives. The tinge of some values may colour some work but that will never be achieved at the cost of pleasure that the blog is intended to provide the readers. It can be said that the teachings will be arranged in the storage of delight in the writings of the blog.  

Hence, the idea to own a blog is actually backed by my motive to entertain the readers. The blog with all its creations will attempt to represent the humanity in large. Therefore, the readers’ visit of it will turn into an amusing feat of their self explorations.

I have a dream to undertake a journey far ahead in future with the blog. This dream may materialise if the readers ignite me with the enthusiasm to serve them with my writings. That zest to serve them will persist if only the readers display an uninterrupted interest in my blog.</strong></p>

    <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
    <p><strong>Motivation is your desire to do something with your personal life, at work, in school, in sports, or in any hobbies. Having the motivation to do something can help you achieve your big goals and dreams, whatever they may be</strong></p>
    <img class="don" src="motivation.png">
    <h3>How to Motivate Yourself: 3 Simple Tricks</h3>
    <h4><ol><li>Create a Positive Environment</li></ol></h4>
    <p><strong>Music can be as powerful a motivator as motivational quotes. Each morning when you wake up, play a few pump up songs before you start your day to get you going. You can listen to playlists with motivational songs on Spotify to help you get going. By getting your mind in the right mindset, you can inch closer to motivating yourself. When I want to get in the zone, I listen to “Time” by Hans Zimmer, which has no lyrics but has an intensity which helps me focus. If I’m feeling like I’m in a rut, motivational songs like “You’re a Superstar” by Love Inc. picks me up.</strong></p>
    <h4><ol><li>Celebrate Your Small Wins</li></ol></h4>
    <p><strong>When you think of your BIG goal, sometimes you start feeling overwhelmed. Why? Because big goals don’t get achieved right away. Instead, you need to create mini goals to help excite you along the way. This way you can be more goal-orientated and build a habit of being more effective. Celebrating your small wins will help you stay motivated through your journey. Plus, celebrating is always super fun. Maybe you break your goal down to 10 small-sized goals with tasks that get you on track to achieve them. For each of the 10 goals you can add a small celebration. Maybe a glass of champagne for one or a dessert with a sparkler on top for another. Don’t forget to check out some of our motivational quotes about success in a later section. </strong></p>
    <h4><ol><li>Surround Yourself With Motivated People </li></ol></h4>
    <p><strong>This goes back to the positive environment point: You need to be around with others who are just ambitious as you. American entrepreneur John Rohn once said, “You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with it.” And whether or not that’s true is debatable, the reality is being around the right kind of people can only help you grow. If you’re surrounded by those who love your ambition, you’ll be more ambitious and achieve more. If you’re surrounded by loved ones who tell you your goals are stupid and tell you to change them, you need to avoid them. Be around those who help you feel comfortable being the ambitious, go-getter you are, so you can become the successful person you’re meant to be. </strong></p>
